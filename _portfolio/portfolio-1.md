_Abstract_

Desert regions have harsh climates and low income levels for residents. Cistanche can serve as a viable economic crop to improve local income, but it requires the support of the Haloxylon ammodendron tree for stable survival. Haloxylon also enhances the local environment and helps curb land desertification. However, the survival rate of Haloxylon is currently low; young trees may be buried by sand or die from harsh weather, while adult trees are at risk from root consumption by sand rats. Addressing these uncontrollable factors is challenging. Therefore, we plan to design an automated vehicle for planting Haloxylon, which will patrol planting bases for replanting efforts. This vehicle will be powered by solar panels and autonomously return to its base for recharging. Our project is divided into four parts: mechanism selection, design, modeling and simulation, and manufacturing. We have successfully implemented a series of actions including seedling emergence, transportation, and drilling for planting. After multiple brainstorming sessions and extensive research, our team utilized SolidWorks for modeling, created animations, calculated torque for the design, adjusted motor rotation cycles, and fabricated components, leading to continuous improvements of our vehicle and achieving the desired functionality.

1. Solution Selection

1.1 Seedling Chamber Mechanism
The seedling release mechanism is primarily realized using a roller. By controlling motor rotation through code, the roller rotates 180 degrees and then pauses, allowing time for seedling release and planting.
This part mainly consists of two components: the seedling chamber and the rotating shaft. The seedling chamber was laser-cut from acrylic sheets and manually assembled. Since the rotating shaft needs to be lightweight with low strength requirements, it was 3D printed.

In the assembly process, we laser-cut acrylic sheets and sliced an acrylic tube into 1/4 arc segments. These were glued together using hot melt glue to create the seedling chamber. The rotating shaft was 3D printed, and using a flange coupling and a flanged bearing, the shaft was connected to both the seedling chamber and the micro stepper motor (5V/1:380).

1.2 Seedling Transport Mechanism

We initially considered two options for the seedling transport mechanism:

1. Conveyor Belt Seedling Transport

In this approach, a seedling storage tube would be used. The tube is aligned with the slanted base of the seedling chamber using a spring mechanism, and the tubeâ€™s body is suspended on a conveyor belt. A half-moon shaped baffle is positioned at the bottom, with a spring connecting the baffle and the tube. At the top of the drill, a baffle ensures that, when the seedling tube reaches the drill, the spring compresses, making the tube vertical and releasing it from the half-moon baffle, allowing the seedling to drop directly. Below is a conceptual diagram of this design:

(Here you would normally include a diagram or further visual reference of the conceptual design).

2. Lever Mechanism-Based Seedling Transport

This method uses a single seedling storage tube. The vertical movement is achieved through a rack-and-pinion mechanism, while a linkage system lifts the entire structure, making it vertical for seedling delivery. The main components include: (1) an assembled cylindrical seedling storage tube, (2) a rack-and-pinion structure with a fixed mount, and (3) two linkages located at the front and middle of the storage tube.

Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages.

The conveyor belt system offers continuous structure and higher efficiency. However, its complex design raises concerns, such as whether the storage tube can properly return to its original position. It also involves considerable material consumption and complicates control, as the conveyor would need to pause and restart multiple times, potentially wasting power or wearing down components. Additionally, when we modeled the conveyor system, adding the seedling chamber made the overall structure too tall (exceeding 1 meter), which raised the center of gravity, making stable movement difficult. Given the harsh environment of desert areas, maintenance of a conveyor belt system would be challenging and expensive.

The lever-based seedling delivery system is simpler, avoiding unnecessary wear and tear. The overall structure is shorter, making it more stable, with simpler mechanics. It also has lower manufacturing and maintenance costs. However, it delivers seedlings one at a time, which reduces efficiency. But considering the drilling and planting process that follows, this lower speed is not a significant drawback.

Given the complexity of design, manufacturing difficulty, and cost considerations, we chose the lever mechanism-based seedling transport method.
