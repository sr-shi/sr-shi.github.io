During this research, I mainly focus on the 3D modeling of elastocaloric cooling device.I use softwares including Creo and Solidworks to achieve that.I also use Ansys to do simulation of the amount of deformation to determine the material to be processed and the thickness of the device.

Now I am preparing for my bachelor thesis about electrocaloric(materials) and my supervisor is Dr. Xiaoshi Qian.
