I am a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University]([https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/]).My research interests mainly lie in elastocaloric cooling(devices and materials) and electrocaloric. I am now focusing on the devices of elastocaloric cooling, exploring its potential for higher temperature difference. I achieve high score in Engineering Material and Fluid Mechanics.I also have a background in PTVs.

I was advised by [Dr. Jingyuan Xu](https://www.imt.kit.edu/3487_3126.php) of ZEco Thermal Lab from [Institute of Microstructure Technologies]([https://www.imt.kit.edu/3484.php]), [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/).

Now I am preparing my bachelor thesis about electrocaloric(thin film materials) and will be advised by Prof. Xiaoshi Qian.
